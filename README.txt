INTRODUCTION
============

This tool is first an LLMNR and NBT-NS responder, it will answer to 
*specific* NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name 
suffix (see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the
tool will only answers to File Server Service request, which is for SMB.
The concept behind this, is to target our answers, and be stealthier on
the network. This also helps to ensure that we don't break legitimate
NBT-NS behavior.
You can set the -r option to 1 via command line if you want this tool to
answer to the Workstation Service request name suffix.

FEATURES
========

- Built-in SMB Auth server.
  Supports NTLMv1, NTLMv2 hashes. Successfully tested from Windows NT4
  to Server 2012 RC, Samba and Mac OSX Lion. This functionality is enabled
  by default when the tool is launched.

- Built-in MSSQL Auth server.
  In order to redirect SQL Authentication to this tool, you will need to
  set the option -r to 1(NBT-NS queries for SQL Server lookup are
  using the Workstation Service name suffix) for systems older than
  windows Vista (LLMNR will be used for Vista and higher). This server
  supports NTLMv1, LMv2 hashes. This functionality was successfully tested
  on Windows SQL Server 2005 & 2008.

- Built-in HTTP Auth server.
  In order to redirect HTTP Authentication to this tool, you will need
  to set the option -r to 1 for Windows version older than Vista (NBT-NS
  queries for HTTP server lookup are sent using the Workstation Service
  name suffix). For Vista and higher, LLMNR will be used. This server 
  supports NTLMv1, NTLMv2 hashes *and* Basic Authentication. This server
  was successfully tested on IE 6 to IE 10, Firefox, Chrome, Safari.

- All hashes are printed to stdout and dumped in an unique file John
  Jumbo compliant, using this format:
  (SMB or MSSQL or HTTP)-(ntlm-v1 or v2 or clear-text)-Client_IP.txt
  The file will be located in the current folder.

- Now logs all Responder activity to a file.

CONSIDERATIONS
==============

- This tool listen on several port: UDP 137, TCP 1433,
  TCP 80, TCP 139, TCP 445, Multicast UDP 5553.
  If you run Samba on your system, stop smbd and nmbd and all other 
  services listening on these ports.

- This tool will *not* work on Windows by default.

- Please note that if you don't use rainbow tables to crack the hashes,
  it is *better* change these 2 vars accordingly in Responder.py:

  line 47: " # Change this if needed. Currently using the same
             challenge as Metasploit since several rainbow tables were
             created with that challenge.
             Challenge = "\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88"
             NumChal = "1122334455667788" "
 
  Apparently, Windows, under certain circumstances does not send valids SMB
  NTLMv1 credentials when the fixed challenge 1122334455667788 is set.
